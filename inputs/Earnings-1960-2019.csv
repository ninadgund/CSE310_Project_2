"Earnings in 2019 dollars, adjusted using the CPI-U-RS.

For information on confidentiality protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and definitions, see <https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/techdocs/cpsmar20.pdf>",,,,,,,,
"A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate's variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights. For more information, see ""Standard Errors and Their Use"" at <https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-270sa.pdf>.",,,,,,,,
